# Events and Debugging Assessment

Time to assess how well you have learned to use the debugging tools in Chrome Dev Tools, and writing click event listeners. This application is to show kids with illnesses and the memories the would like to make. Celebrities sign up to help kids make memories.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Event Listeners to Create

1. When the kid name is clicked, it should display their wish.
1. When the celebrity name is clicked, it should display their sport.
1. The pairings list should should contain the pairing in the following format.
   ```html
   {child name} will be making memories with {celebrity name}, a {celebrity
   sport} star, by {child wish}
   ```

Below is an animation showing how the application should look when complete and how the event listeners should work.

## Setup

Your instruction team will provide a link for you to create your assessment repository. Once your repo is created, clone it to your machine.

1. Make sure you are in your `workspace` directory.
1. `git clone {github repo SSH string}`.
1. `cd` into the directory it creates.
1. `code .` to open the project code.
1. Use the `serve` command to start the web server.
1. Open the URL provided in Chrome.

Make sure your Developer Tools are open at all times while working on this project. Use the messages provided in the Console to determine what code needs to be fixed or implemented, and use breakpoints in the Sources tab to step through your code as you debug.

## Vocabulary and Understanding

Before you click the "Complete Assessment" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below each question and make a commit.

1. When a child is clicked on in the browser, which module contains the code that will execute on that event happening? Can you explain the algorithm of that logic?
   > When a child name is clicked on in the browser, this activates the event listener code in the Kids.js module. This event listener when "clicked" on a DOM element with a "child" dataset type, then extracts the child's name and assigns it to a new variable with .textContent and then also assigns a new variable for the child's wish with itemClicked.dataset.wish. The window alert then uses these two new variables to display the message we want.
2. In the **Pairings** module, why must the `findCelebrityMatch()` function be invoked inside the `for..of` loop that iterates the kids array?
   > In the Pairings module, the findCelebrityMatch() function has to be invoked inside the for..of loop because we first need to iterate the array of kids to find their specific celebrityId to match them with the correct celebrity. If the function was invoked outside of the loop, it would only be called correctly for one of the kids and the rest would be paired with that same celebrity over and over.
3. In the **CelebrityList** module, can you describe how the name of the sport that the celebrity plays can be displayed in the window alert text?
   > In the celebrityList module, we loop through the database of celebrities. Each celebrity has a key of "sport". Within the HTML of each celebrity, we also of a data property for celebrity.sport. When we create the event listener in this module, we capture the name and sport properties for the celebrity that is clicked on. By using itemClicked.dataset.sport to give value to a new variable, we access the sport listed in the database for that specific celebrity.
4. Can you describe, in detail, the algorithm that is in the `main` module?
   > The main module is used to build our application that is created in the other modules. The first 3 lines of code are loading in each of our dependencies. These are the functions that we created in their respective modules that use the information in our databse to create HTML strings for each kid, celebrity, and pairing. We then use queryselector to select our DOM target which has the "container" id. The code that follows that lays out the actual HTML structure of the application and uses template literals to inject the actual HTML generated by the other modules to display information in the application. The final line of code then renders the HTML to the DOM which displays in the browser.
